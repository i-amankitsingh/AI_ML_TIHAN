Pre-Class Notes: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Why should you care about PCA?
Many datasets today have too many features (Titanic ~15, others = thousands).

High dimensions =

Harder to visualize

Slower to process

Lots of redundant information

PCA helps by shrinking the number of features while keeping most of the important information.

Big Ideas Behind PCA
Variance → tells us how “spread out” the data is. More variance = more useful info.

Covariance → tells us how features move together.

Covariance Matrix → puts all feature relationships in one table.

Eigenvectors → special directions that capture the maximum variance (called principal components).

Eigenvalues → numbers showing how important each eigenvector is.

How PCA Works (Step-by-Step)
Start with your data (matrix X).

Center it by subtracting the mean.

Compute the covariance matrix.

Find eigenvalues & eigenvectors.

Sort them by importance (largest eigenvalue first).

Pick the top k components.

Project data into this new smaller subspace.

Applications You’ll See
Iris dataset: reduced 4 features → 2, still keeps ~94% info.

Titanic dataset: reduced 5 → 2, keeps ~66% info.

Great for visualization (2D/3D plots).

Often used before ML models:

Logistic Regression with all features → 80% accuracy

Logistic Regression with PCA(2) features → ~66% accuracy

Extra Nuggets
PCA components are always orthogonal (independent).

Noise usually shows up as low variance, so PCA helps reduce it.

How many components? → Depends on how much variance you want to keep.

Combine PCA with feature engineering for best results.

To really master PCA → revise eigenvalues & eigenvectors.

Tool to use: sklearn.decomposition.PCA.

👉 Think before class:

Why might reducing features sometimes hurt accuracy but still be useful?

Can you think of a dataset where visualization in 2D/3D would really help?


PCA (Principal Component Analysis) – Quick Notes
Why PCA?
Datasets often have many features (e.g., Titanic = 15, others = thousands).
High dimensions → harder to visualize, slower to process, redundant info.
PCA reduces features into new components while keeping most information.
Core Ideas
Variance = spread of data; higher variance = more informative.
Covariance = relationship between two features.
Covariance Matrix = summarizes all feature relationships.
Eigenvectors = directions of max variance (principal components).
Eigenvalues = importance/weight of those directions.
PCA Algorithm Steps
Start with data matrix X (N × D).
Center data → subtract mean.
Compute covariance matrix.
Find eigenvalues & eigenvectors.
Sort eigenvectors by eigenvalues (largest → most important).
Select top k components.
Project data into new k-dimensional subspace.
Applications & Examples
Iris dataset: 4 → 2 features, ~94% variance preserved.
Titanic dataset: 5 → 2 features, ~66% variance preserved.
Helps with visualization (2D/3D) and preprocessing before ML models.
Logistic regression: full features = 80% accuracy; PCA(2) features = ~66%.
Extra Notes
PCA components are orthogonal (independent).
Noise usually has low variance, so PCA reduces its effect.
Number of components depends on desired variance retention.
Feature engineering (e.g., family size, child indicator) can complement PCA.
Learn linear algebra (eigenvalues/vectors) for deeper understanding.
