Lecture Notes: k-NN & SVM Classification
1. Introduction
When we work on classification problems in Machine Learning — like predicting if an email is spam or not spam, or if a tumor is benign or malignant — we often use supervised learning algorithms.

Two popular algorithms for such problems are:

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Both are powerful yet conceptually very different.

Let’s explore them step by step in simple terms.

2. Understanding k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
2.1 What is k-NN?
k-NN stands for k-Nearest Neighbors.

It’s a lazy learning algorithm — meaning it doesn’t learn an explicit model during training.

Instead, it stores the data and uses it at the time of prediction.

In simple words:

“To classify a new data point, k-NN looks at its ‘k’ nearest data points (neighbors) and assigns the majority class among them.”

2.2 Example
Imagine you have a dataset of fruits:

Apples (Red, Round)
Bananas (Yellow, Long)
Now, you get a new fruit that’s Yellow and slightly curved.

k-NN checks the k nearest fruits in your dataset based on similarity (distance).

If most of those neighbors are Bananas, it classifies this new fruit as a Banana.

2.3 How does it work?
Steps in k-NN:

Choose the value of k (number of neighbors to check).
Calculate the distance between the new point and all training points.
Select the k nearest neighbors.
Check which class is most common among those neighbors.
Assign that class to the new point.
3. Distance Metrics in k-NN
Since k-NN relies on distance to find neighbors, choosing the right distance metric is crucial.

Commonly used distance measures:

Euclidean Distance
The straight-line distance between two points.

Formula:d=(x1−y1)2+(x2−y2)2

d=(x1−y1)2+(x2−y2)2d = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2}

Example: Distance between (2, 3) and (5, 7) = √((5−2)² + (7−3)²) = √25 = 5.

Manhattan Distance
Distance along axes (like walking in city blocks).

Formula:d=∣x1−y1∣+∣x2−y2∣

d=∣x1−y1∣+∣x2−y2∣d = |x_1 - y_1| + |x_2 - y_2|

Example: Distance between (2, 3) and (5, 7) = |5−2| + |7−3| = 7.

Minkowski Distance
A generalized form that can act like Euclidean or Manhattan based on a parameter ‘p’.
Cosine Similarity
Measures how similar two vectors are, based on the angle between them.
Often used in text classification.
4. Choosing the Right ‘k’
Choosing k is important — it can affect your model’s accuracy.

If k = 1:

Only the nearest neighbor decides the class → can be noisy (high variance).

If k is too large:

It might include too many distant points from other classes → blurry boundaries (high bias).

💡 Tip:

Start with small odd values (like 3, 5, 7) and test using cross-validation to find the best k.

4.1 Example
Let’s say we are classifying emails:

6 spam emails
4 non-spam emails
If k = 3 and 2 of the nearest neighbors are spam → classify as spam.

If k = 7 and 5 are non-spam → classify as non-spam.

Thus, k affects how “sensitive” the algorithm is to local vs. overall data.

5. Pros and Cons of k-NN
✅ Advantages

Simple and intuitive.
No training time (only prediction time).
Works well for smaller datasets.
❌ Disadvantages

Slow for large datasets (needs to check all distances).
Sensitive to irrelevant features or scaling — feature normalization is important.
Doesn’t perform well when dimensions are very high.
6. Understanding Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6.1 What is SVM?
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

It aims to find a decision boundary (or hyperplane) that best separates the data into different classes.

6.2 Concept in Simple Words
Imagine you have two classes of points (red and blue).

You can draw many possible lines (in 2D) that separate them, but SVM finds the best line — one that maximizes the margin (distance between the line and the nearest data points of each class).

These nearest points are called Support Vectors — they “support” the boundary.

6.3 Example
Suppose we have:

Red dots = Students who failed
Blue dots = Students who passed
SVM tries to draw a line that cleanly separates the two groups with maximum distance from both.

If data can’t be separated by a straight line, SVM uses a kernel trick to project it into a higher dimension where separation becomes possible.

7. SVM Hyperplanes and Margins
A hyperplane is simply a boundary:

In 2D → it’s a line
In 3D → it’s a plane
In higher dimensions → it’s a hyperplane
The goal of SVM is to find the hyperplane that:

Correctly separates classes
Maximizes the margin between them
The margin helps the model generalize better and avoid overfitting.

8. Kernels in SVM
Not all data can be separated by a straight line. That’s where kernels come in.

Kernels help SVM handle non-linear data by transforming it into a higher-dimensional space.

Common Kernels:
Linear Kernel
Used when data is linearly separable.
Example: Text classification.
Polynomial Kernel
Adds polynomial terms to create curved boundaries.
Example: Classifying data shaped like a circle.
RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel
Creates circular decision boundaries.
Very popular and works for most cases.
8.1 Example
Imagine separating two sets of points arranged in a circle — red inside, blue outside.

A straight line can’t do it.

But RBF kernel maps this data to a higher space where SVM can draw a clear boundary.

9. Comparing k-NN and SVM
Feature	k-NN	SVM
Learning Type	Lazy (no model built)	Eager (builds a model)
Decision Boundary	Non-parametric, depends on neighbors	Fixed boundary using margin

10. Key Takeaways
k-NN classifies based on similarity with nearby points.
SVM separates classes using the best possible boundary.
Distance metrics like Euclidean and Manhattan play a major role in k-NN.
Choosing k wisely improves accuracy.
SVM kernels allow handling both linear and non-linear data.
Both are strong baseline models for classification problems.
