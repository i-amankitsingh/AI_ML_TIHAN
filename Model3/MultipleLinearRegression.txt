Lecture Notes: Regression Model Evaluation & Multiple Linear Regression
🌟 1. What Is Regression?
Regression is a method used when we want to predict numbers.

It helps us find patterns between input factors (like hours studied) and outcomes (like marks scored).

🧠 Think of it like saying:

“If I know how much you study, sleep, and attend classes — can I guess your score?”

It’s not about “yes” or “no” — it’s about how much or how many.

🪜 2. From Simple to Multiple Regression
🔹 Simple Regression
When there’s one input and one output, we call it simple regression.

Example: Predicting a person’s weight based only on their height.

But in real life, outcomes depend on many things, not just one.

🔹 Multiple Regression
When there are many input factors, it becomes Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).

Example:

Predicting car mileage (km/l) depends on:

Engine size
Car weight
Fuel type
Number of gears
Air conditioning (yes/no)
Each of these features contributes differently.

MLR helps combine them all to give one best possible prediction.

🚀 3. Why Multiple Regression Is Useful
Multiple regression gives a complete picture.

Let’s say you’re trying to predict a student’s performance.

Depending only on study hours may not be enough — you also need:

Sleep hours
Attendance
Number of assignments completed
Each factor tells a small part of the story.

Together, they help you predict more accurately.

That’s why MLR is widely used in:

Marketing → predicting sales based on price, ads, and discounts
Healthcare → predicting blood pressure using age, weight, and activity
Finance → predicting loan defaults based on income and credit score
⚖️ 4. Checking How Good the Model Is
After building a regression model, we must ask:

👉 “Is my model actually good at predicting?”

We measure this using evaluation metrics.

Here’s how to think of them in simple terms:

🧾 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Imagine you guessed everyone’s marks and compared them with the real ones.

MAE tells you, on average, how far your guesses were from reality.

Smaller MAE → better model.

🔍 Mean Squared Error (MSE)
This one is like MAE but gives extra punishment for big mistakes.

It’s helpful when large errors are costly — like predicting hospital bills.

🎯 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Think of it as a “standard mistake size” your model makes.

It’s in the same units as the target (e.g., rupees, kilometers, etc.),

so it’s easier to explain to non-technical people.

📈 R-squared (R²)
This tells you how much of the outcome your model explains.

If R² = 0.9, it means your model explains 90% of what’s going on — pretty good!

If R² is low, the model is missing some key factors.

⚙️ Adjusted R-squared
When you add more variables, R² always increases —

even if those variables don’t help.

Adjusted R² fixes that by growing only when the new variable truly adds value.

🧠 5. A Quick Scenario
Imagine you’re a restaurant owner trying to predict monthly sales.

You consider:

Number of ads posted
Average food price
Customer reviews
Weather condition (sunny or rainy)
After training your regression model, you check how close the predicted sales are to actual sales.

If your predictions are mostly close — small average error, high R² —

your model is doing a great job!

If your predictions are often way off, or your R² is low —

the model may need better features, more data, or simpler relationships.

🪞 6. Common Issues in Regression
🚧 Overfitting
Your model fits the training data too well — like memorizing answers instead of learning concepts.

It works perfectly on old data but performs poorly on new data.

You can spot it when training accuracy is high but test accuracy is low.

🪫 Underfitting
Your model is too simple — it misses key relationships.

This happens when you ignore important variables or use a weak model.

Both training and test accuracy will be low.

✅ Goal: A balanced model that performs well on both training and unseen data.

🔍 7. How to Improve Regression Models
Remove unnecessary features that add noise.
Standardize or scale numeric values so that all features have equal impact.
Check for correlated inputs — if two features are almost the same, drop one.
Use cross-validation — test your model on small unseen parts of data before finalizing.
Collect better data — sometimes the issue is not the model but poor data quality.
