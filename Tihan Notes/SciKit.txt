Pre-Class Notes – ML Pipelines with scikit-learn (B1)
1. What is a Pipeline in ML?

A way to connect multiple steps (data preprocessing, model training) into a single workflow.
Helps keep code clean, reusable, and less error-prone.
2. Why use Pipelines?

Automates repetitive tasks.
Ensures same preprocessing is applied to both training and test data.
Makes experiments easier to manage.
3. Basic Structure in scikit-learn


from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('step_name1', transformer1),
    ('step_name2', transformer2),
    ('model', estimator)
])
4. Common Steps in a Pipeline

Preprocessing: Scaling, encoding, missing value handling.
Feature Selection: Picking important features.
Model Training: Fitting a chosen algorithm.
5. Key Benefits

One command to fit and predict.
Reduces chances of data leakage.
Easy to tune parameters using GridSearchCV with the pipeline.
💡 Quick Example:


from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

pipe = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('model', LogisticRegression())
])

pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = pipe.predict(X_test)
